When an amateur like me goes on a winter trek, he wishes to see some snow.
Well snow, as it is with all good things, is not able to keep up with the
 expectation of first timers.  Me and a few others were starting to feel a bit
 disappointed at the apparent lack of snow. The experienced guy, travelling
 with us from Rishikesh to Lohajung(the starting point of our trek),
 with __many__ treks under his belt was sleeping as if there was no tomorrow.
 After we had given up all hope of snow and had finished gloating about the
 broken promises the recent updates from the organizers had promised, there
 was pin drop silence.  Silence, then some more, then dozing off for and maybe
 snoring and then a shrill shriek of excitement at the first sight of snow.
 It felt as we had reached the promised land. This is how the Brahmatal trek
 started for me.

## A Bit of Background

When I came to Bangalore in 2013, I instantly fell in love with the weather.
 Bangalore felt like relief from the hot and humid climate of West Bengal,
 my native. After almost 7 years, the weather is not what it used to be back
 when I came to the city, but I still love it.  On the other side, I had
 started missing the variety that the rest of India experiences. Winters in
 Bangalore are pretty lame by North Indian standards. In Bangalore the mercury
 sometimes dips as low as 18°C. Well I clearly had no idea what it meant to be
 at -10°C or less. 


I had already tasted blood when I had done my first high altitude trek, the
Dayara Bugyal Trek. It was clear that trekking was going at be a big thing in
 my life. What was not clear was when I would go next? Crazy things happenning
in my personal life did not make things easy. But the heart does not understand
logic. It is like a baby that just wants, no matter how unreasonable the demand
is.


I used to catch myself daydreaming often about my next trek pretty often and
scold myself back to my senses, but remembering how it was important to do
things that I did not like to please people I did not like
