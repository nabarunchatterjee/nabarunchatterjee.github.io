When an amateur like me goes on a winter trek, he wishes to see some snow.

Well, snow, as it is with all good things, is not able to keep up with the
expectation of first timers.  I and a few others were starting to feel a bit
disappointed at the apparent lack of snow. The experienced guy, traveling with
us from Rishikesh to Lohajung(the starting point of our trek), with __many__
treks under his belt was sleeping as if there was no tomorrow.  After we had
given up all hope of snow and had finished gloating about the broken promises
the recent updates from the organizers had indicated, there was pin-drop
silence.  Silence, then some more, then some dozing off for and maybe snoring,
and then a shrill shriek of excitement at the first sight of snow.  It felt as
we had reached the promised land. This is how the Brahmatal trek started for
me.

## A Bit of Background

### The Rookie
When I came to Bangalore in 2013, I instantly fell in love with the weather.
Bangalore felt like relief from the hot and humid climate of West Bengal, my
native. After almost 7 years, the weather is not what it used to be back when I
came to the city, but I still love it.  On the other side, I had started
missing the variety that the rest of India experiences. Winters in Bangalore
are pretty lame by North Indian standards. In Bangalore, the mercury sometimes
dips as low as 18°C during winter.  Well, I clearly had no idea what it meant to
be at -10°C(predicted temperature on the trek) or less. 

### The Urge
I had already tasted blood when I had done my first high altitude trek, the
Dayara Bugyal Trek. It was clear from then on that trekking was going to be
a big thing in my life. What was not clear was when I would go next?
Crazy things happening in my personal life did not make things easy.
But the heart does not understand logic. It is like a baby that just wants,
no matter how unreasonable the demand is.

## The Trek

Before starting the trek we flew to New Delhi, took a train to Haridwar, and
then an auto to Rishikesh. Nothing worth mentioning here. We did mediocre
touristy things.  I will let the pictures do the talking till we reach
Rishikesh.

We reached Rishikesh at around 6 in the evening. We had booked a room in Zostel
as IndiaHikes had designated this hotel as the pickup point for our 10-hour
ride to Lohajung early the next morning. I had never been at a Zostel before and liked the vibe very much.
After a quick shower and early dinner, we went to sleep early.

Delhi was cold but Rishikesh had taken it to that level where you start feeling
that you are on a winter trip.  This was my first winter trek and my excitement
was through the roof. Had no problem falling asleep that night with the
knowledge that I was no longer in the plains and things were about to get much
more interesting from the next day onwards.

### Day 1 - Rishikesh to Lohajung [Anticipation]

I am not a morning person. On the rare occasion, I do have to wake up early, I
feel groggy and irritated at the state of the world and my life for no apparent
reason.  But not when I travel. When I travel I wake up with a foolish grin,
ready to accept whatever the day has in store for me. This is a wonderful
feeling.

At Rishikesh, we woke at 5 in the morning and quickly put on our layers and got
ready for the ride to Lohajung, where our trek would start the next morning.
We met all our trek mates who were staying in other hotels in Rishikesh or had
just arrived and then at around 6:30 we started the ride. It was still dark
outside.

Within 5 minutes of the car starting, I, for no reason at all started
anticipating snow. I did not disclose this to anyone though for the fear of
being ridiculed.  The day turned out to be sunny and beautiful. We passed
Devprayag on the way.  For those who don't know, Devprayag(meaning `Godly
Confluence`) is the meeting point of the rivers Alakananda and Bhagirathi. It
is believed that a third river Saraswati meets the other two at this point but
is not visible as it is underground.

We were traveling with 3 other guys(not mentioning names or posting pics for
privacy). We had some wonderful conversations and also enjoyed the view along
the way but when the sun started to set it became quiet inside the car. After 1
hour of deafening silence and dozing on and off, I started to feel a little
restless and at last confessed to everyone my disappointment about the lack of
snow. The veteran of many previous treks traveling with us that day decided
to keep silent instead of assuring us. I imagine he silently chuckled and
thought "Kids!!!"

When I finally did see some snow I absolutely lost it and started shouting in
excitement but to my utter surprise, Sagnika and the others in the car were
shouting too. I found peace in the fact that there were some other impulsive
people like me on this trek.

When we reached our stay for the night, we were briefed by our trek leader on
basic rules to follow in a winter trek and went through some basic health checks, and
were allotted our gloves for the trek.  We had a simple, yet tasty dinner and
went to bed early in our allotted dormitory.

I had thought that the day had ended with me going to sleep but God had other
ideas.

I woke up to the sound of teeth chattering loudly. It took me a second to realize
that it was my own.  You see my short stature and my timid face do a good job
of hiding it but in my head, I am a bit of a macho. So just before sleeping it
was an easy choice for my `"I have seen it all"` attitude to decide that I did
not need to wear the thicker woolen socks or the second layer of jackets as
prescribed. I did not know it then but the temperature that night was -2°C. I
was clearly out of my depth.

I mustered enough courage to come out of the thick blanket to look for the
required clothing in the dark.  As soon as I opened my bag, a loud sound
startled me and for one moment I felt like a thief even though I was looking
through my own bag.  After I came back to my senses I realized that someone in
our room had chosen that exact moment to start snoring loudly like a
helicopter.  Fortunately, I found my clothes quickly enough and became warm in
less than 5 minutes and fell asleep dreaming of what breathtaking views I would
witness the next morning.


### Day 2 - Lohajung to Bekaltal [First Blood]

Since we had reached a little late the previous night we were not able to see
the surroundings. The next day I did some walking near the lodge before breakfast
and took in the views of the surroundings of Lohajung.

After we had our breakfast, we were allotted our
[microspikes](https://www.amazon.in/Microspikes-Women-Men-Traction-Crampons/dp/B077MV4MJ4),
to help us walk on slippery ice.  I feel a little foolish saying this but I did
not know that there was a difference between ice and snow before I came to this
trek.

For me, the 30 minutes of the first day of the trek is the hardest. It
is not because the terrain is tough or the fact that we have not reached
high enough to see the surroundings properly but because of my untrained mind.
My mind at this point is riddled with a thousand doubts.  Will I be able to finish the trek?
Will I like it? Will Sagnika like it? Nobody else is carrying a camera, will
the added weight become too much? What if I incur some leg injury or breathing
problems? What if I am not able to sleep properly in my tent? What was the need
for all this trouble? We could have easily gone on some other popular trip,
have a cozy hotel room with 24 hours room service.

All these vanish after the first 30 minutes once you breathe in enough of the
clean mountain air, get high on the grand views of the mighty mountains, the
snow-covered ground and the beautiful mixture of the white and green treetops.

| My camera does not do justice to the moment. The sounds, the smell, the excitement, the weather can only be enjoyed by being present |

After sometime when the initial panting gave way to awe, Sagnika for no reason
at all turned around and gave me a smile and I knew that she was enjoying it.

At one point of the trek, we passed through some forest where I was silently
enjoying the occasional bird call or the soft sound of small chunks of snow
falling from leaves due to the wind. It was magical. 

After had lunch, we stopped at the only shack on the way to have some coffee
and wear our
[gaiters](https://www.decathlon.in/p/8347880/forclaz/trek-500-trekking-gaiters-black)

Within the next few minutes, the scene changed completely and we had to walk
through some deep snow. It seemed we were in the sets of Frozen or in someplace on the other side of the wall in GOT.

We reached the Bekaltal campsite at around 3 in the afternoon and spent the
rest of the day at the campsite and the surroundings.  Though we had reached
the campsite we were yet to see  Bekal"tal"(Tal means lake). We were told that
we would visit the lake first thing in the morning tomorrow.

### Day 3 - Bekaltal to Telandi [Blown Away]

Our trek started with us visiting the frozen Bekaltal. We gathered and took
some pictures and listened to some stories about the lake from the local guide.

|![nice]({{site.url}}/assets/images/brahmatal/nice.jpg)|

The days leading up to the trek were not the smoothest. I was having problems
at work and in my personal life.  Generally, I escape these problems by having
unhealthy amounts of junk food. This was not an option this time as I had to
get fit for the trek. Another thing that I do when I am depressed is spending a
little longer in bed every morning. This also was not possible as I had to wake
up every morning to run in the nearby park. Indiahikes, the startup that
arranged this trek had a prerequisite that one had to be able to run 5
kilometers in 40 minutes. This might be a piece of cake for some of you but it
was not for me. Moreover, I also had to motivate Sagnika to run with me and
counter all her innovative excuses to not go on a run on any given day. The
Bangalore traffic did not help either. Especially while coming back from
the office, there were times when it used to take 90 minutes for me to return home.
Sometimes while stuck in traffic I used to question my life decisions and feel
generally pissed off at life. But at night when it was time to fall asleep but I
was unable to do so with all the troublesome thoughts in my head I used
to close my eyes and try to imagine what the surroundings would look like on the
upcoming trek. I used to imagine knee-deep snow, forests with snow-covered
trees, snowfall, and so much more. This was my daily lullaby of sorts in
those days.

The scenery on this day of the trek closely resembled what I had imagined in
the days before the trek.  Hence I made it a point to not take many pictures
and just be present at the moment. Though I was yet to see the best views of
this trek it was this part of the trek that made all my troubles go away.

I also did not talk a lot during this part of the trek. Trekking has a
meditative effect on me.  During the trek, I am either thinking of how tired I am or I am trying
to absorb as much of the scenery as I can.  All the junk in my mind, the ones I
had carried with me from the city had faded away and did not return till I
came back to Bangalore. 

This is why I prefer a trek over other forms of travel. It physically tires your
the body, fills the mind and heart with one breathtaking view after another and
doesn't leave any bandwidth to think about city life problems.


Moving on.

At about 1 PM we reached the Telandi campsite. Telandi is a piece of flat land
the size of a medium-sized football field in the middle of nowhere.  It was
white as far I could see. To say I was blown away would not be exact. I was
almost blown away by the crazy amount of wind blowing at the campsite.
Generally, by the time we reach a campsite all the tents are already set up but
not today. The guides and kitchen staff accompanying us were having a hard
time stopping the tents from blowing away.

| It was windy and we were having a hard time keeping the tents from flying |

Did I already mention that I met a wonderful man on this trek? This man was
jovial all the time and did not worry at all about the future and it seemed
he had it all figured out. I instantly had this urge to try to be like this
man from now on.

That is too much to digest in one article. For those thinking of pressing the
back button or going to a different tab in your browser, hold on for a little
longer. 

Since there is a lot more to write and a lot more crazy moments yet to happen on
this trek, I would like to end it here today and continue this in the next part
of the story which will be published exactly one week from now. Hang on till
then and let me know what you think of this article. Love it, hate it but
please do comment below.

Bye. Have a great weekend ahead.
