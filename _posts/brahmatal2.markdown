## Ending Thoughts

In this article, I have actively avoided talking about my trekmates not because
I dont have a lot to tell, it is just because some of them might have privacy
concerns. But there are some things which I need to say to make this article whole.
In the few days of the trek we, the team, had become something more
than the sum of our parts.  During the trek people talked about how we were
such an awesome team to trek with, how the food was nice, the weather was
favourable, the stories we shared were memorable.  A lot of it was true, but
what made it magical were the parts that we did not talk about.  Silently
fighting the cold, trying to sleep on uneven ground, feeling tired on the trek,
hard to catch one's breath.  As they say "Silence has the power to convey
things which words never can".  In our minds we were all alone, but thinking of
mostly the same things.  It is the friends that you make during times of
hardship are the ones that matter the most.  I am almost sure that most of us
will lose touch with each other after sometime, but whenever I think of the
Brahmatal, I will think about you people and the silent things we did not talk
about and whenever I think of you people, I will breathe in a bit
of Brahmatal.
