|Early days of 2-getherness(2013)|End days of 2-getherness(2020)|

First of all, wishing you all a Happy New Year. 2020 has been a very puzzling
year for all of us.  My heart goes out to anyone who has been through a tough
time during the last few months.  I hope 2021 is different for all of us.
Happier and pandemic free.

Oddly enough, 2020 has been pretty good to me. Like everyone else it has been
hugely puzzling but I can actually go ahead and say that this has been a great
year.

2020, being a great year might seem like a highly unpopular opinion but I will
explain.

<!--More-->

In 2020:

* I did my first winter trek. 
* Towards the start of the year I was able to quit my soul-sucking job and join
  a new one where I am considerably happier.
* Sometime in May I came to know that I was going to be a father.
* A slight push from my manager helped me start my public speaking journey. 
* Last but not least, I was finally able to kill the procrastination demons
  and start my blog.

But what makes this year really special was that I was able to spend a lot of
time with my wife. Although both me and Sagnika don't have to go to office in
the next few months, it will no longer be just the 2 of us as we are expecting
a child this month. Hence, the title.

Both I and Sagnika are thrilled at the thought of becoming parents, but it does
have its downsides. The biggest one being the lack of freedom. All decisions
henceforth will have to be with the baby's best interest in mind which will
reduce flexibility significantly.  But before that happens let us do a quick
recap of how we went from being strangers to expecting parents.

Now that I think about it, these last few years after I met Sagnika have been a
whirlwind of events.  I met Sagnika during the last days of my masters at
Kalyani. This was in December of 2012. We both ~~fell~~ rose in love quickly as
both of our courses would end in 3 months and then I would move to
Bangalore for my first job.

Then after a difficult long-distance relationship of 3 years, we got married in
December of 2015.

In the first six months of our marriage, it became absolutely clear that this
was a mistake and it was only a matter of time until we separated.

We used to fight a lot during the first 2 years. One of the things that kept us
going was our love for food.

Oh, and did I mention the absurd amounts of chocolate we had during that time.

We also traveled a bit during this time. Mostly unplanned weekend trips. Since
I am infamous for unnecessarily long rants, I will let the pictures do the
talking.

We have also been to Yercaud, Munnar, Waynad, Mysore, Nandi Hills but I could
find good pictures for them.

One very significant thing that started happening during this time was that our
love of food was not only making us very happy but also very fat.

So we decided to do something about it. I mean the fat, not the happiness. We
decided to go for a trek.

Since trekking and being fat do not go together our pictures changed to things
like this.

Of all the things the preparation for trekking did to us, the fat reduction was
the most significant.

Then of course we went for the treks.

First the Dayara Bugyal Trek.

And then the Brahmatal Trek.

We did the Brahmatal trek in January 2020 and then before we could plan
anything else the pandemic started and we got pregnant and hence the countdown
to our last days of 2-getherness started.

## Ending Thoughts

Contrary to our understanding, we truly fell in love and were at ease with each
other long after we got married. We had thought that in our case it was love
that lead to marriage while actually, it was marriage that had lead to true
love.

The pictures below illustrates the reduction in awkwardness and increase of
color in our relationship.

To those who are newly married and are going through a tough time in their
relationship, I would like to say hold on a little longer, try a little harder.
Letting go is very easy and can be done at any time but building a relationship
and then a family needs a lot of perseverance. However dark it may feel right
now it will eventually be worth it.

With the start of this month, the clock has started ticking for the arrival of
our child and soon there will be 3 of us.
